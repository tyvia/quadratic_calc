## General info 
As the name suggests, this program solves different types of quadratic equations.

## Installation and setup
1. Download all source files into one folder.
2. Compile with GCC.

## Usage
After you start the program, you will see a menu with 3 options:
* s(solve): prompts the user to enter coefficients, and, if they are entered correctly, solves the equation;
* h(help): outputs a short manual on how to use a program;
* q(quit): quits the program.

To choose an option, print a letter corresponding to it, and hit `<Enter>`.

To enter coefficients, print them in `a b c` format, e.g. for solving equation like 2*x^2 - 9 = 0, print `2 0 9` and hit `<Enter>`.

## Additional info
* Menu input processor is not sensible to register, so you can enter both lowercase and uppercase letters.
* But you can enter ***only*** letters, entering words will cause an error.
* This calculator ***does not*** support complex numbers.
